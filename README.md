**ii. Communication:**
   - **Input-Output Redirection:**
     - Redirects output to a file: `command > output.txt`
     - Appends output to a file: `command >> output.txt`
     - Redirects input from a file: `command < input.txt`

   - **Pipe:**
     - Connects the output of one command to the input of another: `command1 | command2`

**iii. Protection Management:**
   - `chmod` (change mode): Changes file permissions.
     Example: `chmod +x filename`

   - `chown` (change owner): Changes the owner of a file.
     Example: `chown new_owner filename`

   - `chgrp` (change group): Changes the group of a file.
     Example: `chgrp new_group filename`


     ## Operating System Concepts for Viva Exam

Here are some key operating system concepts that you may be asked about during your viva exam:

**1. Processes and Threads:**

* **Process:** An instance of a program in execution. It has its own memory space, resources, and state.
* **Thread:** A lightweight unit of execution within a process. Multiple threads can be running within a single process.
* **Process States:** New, Ready, Running, Waiting, Terminated.
* **Context Switching:** The process of switching the CPU from one process to another.
* **Inter-process Communication (IPC):** Mechanisms for processes to communicate with each other, such as pipes, shared memory, and message queues.

**2. Memory Management:**

* **Virtual Memory:** Technique that allows a process to access more memory than is physically available.
* **Paging:** Dividing a process's memory into fixed-size pages and storing them on disk.
* **Segmentation:** Dividing a process's memory into variable-size segments.
* **Demand Paging:** Loading pages into memory only when they are needed.
* **Thrashing:** When a process spends more time paging than executing.

**3. Scheduling:**

* **CPU Scheduling Algorithms:** Deciding which process to run on the CPU next.
* **Preemptive and Non-preemptive Scheduling:** Preemptive scheduling allows the OS to interrupt a running process and give the CPU to another process.
* **First Come First Served (FCFS):** Processes are scheduled in the order they arrive.
* **Shortest Job First (SJF):** The process with the shortest execution time is chosen next.
* **Priority Scheduling:** Processes are assigned priorities and the highest priority process is chosen next.

**4. File Systems:**

* **Hierarchical file system:** Organizes files into directories and subdirectories.
* **Inodes:** Store information about a file, such as its size, location, and permissions.
* **Disk Scheduling Algorithms:** Deciding the order in which disk requests are serviced.
* **FCFS:** Disk requests are serviced in the order they arrive.
* **Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF):** The disk request with the shortest seek time is chosen next.
* **SCAN:** The disk arm moves back and forth across the disk, servicing requests in its path.

**5. Security:**

* **Authentication:** Verifying the identity of a user.
* **Authorization:** Determining what resources a user is allowed to access.
* **Access Control Mechanisms:** Mechanisms for protecting resources, such as passwords, access control lists (ACLs), and capabilities.
* **Security Threats:** Viruses, worms, malware, and other threats to computer systems.

**6. Deadlocks:**

* A situation where two or more processes are waiting for each other to release resources they need.
* **Deadlock Prevention:** Techniques for preventing deadlocks from occurring.
* **Deadlock Detection and Recovery:** Techniques for detecting and recovering from deadlocks.

**Tips for Viva Exam:**

* **Be prepared to discuss the concepts in detail.**
* **Be able to apply the concepts to real-world examples.**
* **Be able to explain the trade-offs between different operating systems.**
* **Be confident and enthusiastic.**

**Remember, it is important to understand the concepts and not just memorize the definitions.** Your viva examiner will be able to tell if you have a deep understanding of the material.
